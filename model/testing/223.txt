Mia Lin 在 Instagram: "新年快樂🥰請你吃年夜飯🥢🥘🥩🍖🥡很久沒有在洛杉磯過年了，記得小時候都是姑姑為我準備年夜飯，今年我決定挑戰自己，親手煮年夜飯給家人吃！😆沒想到不太會煮飯的我居然成功了！🥳🎆🧨 聖經上說，我靠着那加给我力量的，凡事都能作。💪💪不論你現在面對的挑戰或夢想是什麼，別害怕去嘗試——神必會為你開路，加添力量給你，因為祂對你有美好的計劃😉。

祝福大家新的一年，新酒新油，聖靈啟示，靈巧如蛇，突破盲點。願你和你的家人每一天都充滿盼望，擁有平安和喜樂！🧧

Happy Lunar New Year! 🥰  I’m treating you to a virtual Lunar New Year’s Eve dinner 🥢🥘🥩🍖🥡. It’s been a while since I’ve celebrated the Lunar New Year in Los Angeles. In the past, my aunt would always cook the big dinner for me, but this year, I decided to take on the challenge and cook the meal for my family! I can’t believe I actually pulled it off! 🥳🎆🧨
As the Bible says, “ I can do all this through Him who gives me strength” Whatever challenges or dreams you’re facing, don’t be afraid to take that first step—God will strengthen you and open a way for you, because He has an amazing plan for you. 😉

Wishing everyone a Happy Lunar New Year! The new year brings new wine and new oil—new revelations from the Holy Spirit, so you will be as wise as serpents! This will lead you to new breakthroughs. Here’s to a year full of hope, joy, and peace!🧧happy 2025!! 🎉"
