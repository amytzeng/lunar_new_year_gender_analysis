"This unprecedented proposal, that has never been implemented against any other country, constitutes a clear attempt to harm Israel while we are still fighting a war imposed on us by the October 7 terror attack -- the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust," Sa'ar said in the letter. "Pressure through sanctions will not work. The State of Israel is a proud sovereign nation, and we will not be bent through threats while Israel's security is at stake. As has been clearly stated by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, initiatives of this nature embolden Hamas, harden its stance, and undermine progress toward potential agreements. These kinds of measures will also harm European citizens as it will raise prices of commodities," he said. -ABC News' Jordana Miller

Sep 16, 2025, 4:55 PM EDT Palestinians flee Gaza City after Israeli forces expand ground offensive Video shows Palestinians evacuating from northern Gaza and heading south on Tuesday, fleeing after Israeli forces expanded their ground offensive in Gaza City. People can be seen in the footage fleeing by any means necessary -- by car, sitting on top of their belongings with others piled onto flat-bed trucks or walking. Some were seen carrying belongings over their heads or on their shoulders. People continued to make their way south as the sun went down on Tuesday evening and as it became dark. The IDF said on Monday that about 300,000 people already left Gaza City in the past few weeks. That leaves an estimated 700,000 civilians still in the city who remain under heavy bombardment. It is unclear how many people have left since the IDF began their expanded ground offensive Monday evening. -ABC News' Diaa Ostaz
