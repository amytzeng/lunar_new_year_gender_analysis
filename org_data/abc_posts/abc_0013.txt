Luigi Mangione: Judge tosses 2 state murder charges related to act of terrorism Mangione has pleaded not guilty to killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. By Aaron Katersky , Peter Charalambous , and Megan Forrester September 16, 2025, 10:07 AM 5:16 Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, walks at Manhattan Supreme Court on the day he appears on New York State murder and terrorism charges, in New York City, September 16, 2025. Mike Segar/Reuters A judge dismissed two murder charges related to acts of terrorism as Luigi Mangione, the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, made his first Manhattan courtroom appearance in five months on Tuesday. Judge Gregory Carro tossed out the most severe charge, first-degree murder, accusing Mangione of murder as a crime of terrorism. The judge said the evidence presented to the grand jury was insufficient to support the terrorism charge. Luigi Mangione is escorted into Manhattan state court in New York, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. Seth Wenig/AP “While the defendant was clearly expressing an animus toward UHC, and the health care industry generally, it does not follow that his goal was to ‘intimidate and coerce a civilian population,’ and indeed, there was no evidence presented of such a goal,” the judge wrote in a decision issued on Tuesday morning. Prosecutors argued Mangione’s actions intimidated or coerced employees of UnitedHealthcare, but Carro rejected the argument those fears are enough to justify a terrorism charge. Carro also tossed a second-degree murder charge, related to killing as an act of terrorism.

"We respect the Court's decision and will proceed on the remaining nine counts, including Murder in the Second Degree," the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said in a statement following the ruling.

During his appearance on Tuesday, Mangione wore shackles and beige jail garb over a brown T-shirt. He did not speak during the brief hearing.

Prosecutors said they deleted the materials as soon as they became aware of them and brought it to the attention of both the defense and the court.
