Suspect sought after car rams FBI gate in potential 'act of terror,' official says The suspect, whom the FBI said may be dangerous, was being sought. By Jessica Gorman and Kevin Shalvey September 17, 2025, 4:49 AM 2:12 A vehicle sits outside the FBI Pittsburgh building after a suspect allegedly rammed the fence and fled the scene, Sept. 17, 2025. WTAE A Pennsylvania man drove his car into a metal gate at the FBI building in Pittsburgh early on Wednesday, a ramming that federal law enforcement officials described as intentional, saying the man was being sought as a suspect. Donald Henson, of Penn Hills, allegedly drove at a high rate of speed toward the main entrance gate at about 2:40 a.m., FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Giordano said during a press briefing. "We look at this as an act of terror against the FBI," Giordano said. "This was a targeted attack on this building. Thankfully no one was hurt, but we are going to exhaust every ability we have under the federal law to find, apprehend and prosecute this subject to the fullest extent." There was "some vulgarity" scrawled on the side of the vehicle, the FBI said. The full details of what was written were not immediately clear, Giordano said, adding that there appeared to be a reference to suicide. He said the suspect fled the scene and it was believed that he may be dangerous. It was not immediately clear if Henson was armed, the FBI said.
