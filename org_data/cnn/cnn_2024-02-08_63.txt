Millions of families across the world are celebrating the Lunar New Year, widely considered the most treasured festival in the Chinese calendar.

Also known as the Spring Festival, celebrations begin on February 10 this year and last 15 days.

In 2024, those who celebrate will bid farewell to the Year of the Rabbit and usher in the Year of the Dragon — the only mythical creature on the Chinese zodiac calendar which symbolizes power, progress and luck.

Traditional Lunar New Year festivities include the exchange of "red packets" of money, fireworks, lion dances and travel to bring in good fortune, prosperity and togetherness.

This holiday season also marks the first time in several years for celebrations to take place across mainland China without any Covid-19 restrictions.

Wintry conditions and blizzards have not deterred millions of urban workers from braving crowded stations and huge traffic jams to set off their to hometowns to ring in the Year of the Dragon. Billions of trips are made within China during the 40-day travel period called "Chunyun" — and is often regarded the world's largest annual human migration.

At the heart of the travel frenzy is a time for millions of families in the country and overseas to cherish time together.
