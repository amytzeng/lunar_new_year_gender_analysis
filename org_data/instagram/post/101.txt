To my dearest S4 students of 2024, 

Happy POP!! Hope you enjoyed the program brought to you by your Juniors. I particularly liked the part where they prepared an intro of you which went on to their thank you notes. 

The program did not require the teachers to make any speeches as we know you will want more time with your Juniors.. 

Sooooo .... I will use this platform then!! I would like to represent the teachers to say a Big Big Big thank you to each and everyone of you for your contribution to the CCA! 

You guys survived and excelled throughout the four years, as we navigated from mask on to mask off, online SYF to SYF with public audience. I am especially proud of you all for the wonderful performance and teamwork displayed for Cirque du Consonance V. Whenever I recall how you rose to the occasion when I asked for help with the artistic designs for the E program, the slides and the script, I can't help but swell with pride. ü•∞

To my Exco, thank you for leading your cohort throughout your stint. I saw how rocky the working relationship was at the start. I saw all the efforts put in to resolve issues. I saw the dedication and passion to bring the CCA to another level. GOOD JOB WELL DONE! 2023/2024 was full of ups and downs for us but we did it!! 

So my S4 students, I shan't say things like sad to see you go etc. as I feel that it's time for you to bring all that you have learnt to another arena and shine your brightest! 

As you move on from CCHMS to your future endeavours, I wish nothing but the best for all of u. May you all know what you want to achieve in your future and attain them all! 

Remember this: THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER!!
